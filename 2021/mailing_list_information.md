# CETC mailing lists

## For conference notifications

To receive a notification each year about the call for papers and the submission deadline you should visit [https://www.economics.utoronto.ca/conferences/index.php/cetc/2023](https://www.economics.utoronto.ca/conferences/index.php/cetc/2023) and create an account.  You don't need a new account if you already have one so use the 'Forgot my password' link.  You can adjust your mail notifications there and turn them off if you don't want emails.
