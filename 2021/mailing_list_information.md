# CETC mailing list - 2021

## For conference notifications

The main conference mailing list is at [https://microeconomics.ca/mailman/listinfo/cetc](https://microeconomics.ca/mailman/listinfo/cetc).

You can join the list there if you are not currently getting notifications.  You can unsubscribe there (it is on the lower part of the page).  The members of the mailing list will receive emails about conference or seminar submission deadlines.

## For conference seminar listings

This year, the 'conference program' will consist of a series of seminars.  See the main page at [https://microeconomics.ca](https://microeconomics.ca) for more information. 

If you would like to get email notifications once a seminar is scheuled and on the day of a seminar to tell you who is speaking, the title and the twitch url, you can do that by joining the mailing list at [https://microeconomics.ca/mailman/listinfo/cetc_seminars](https://microeconomics.ca/mailman/listinfo/cetc_seminars).

It works the same way as the main list, but you have to join or leave the lists separately.
