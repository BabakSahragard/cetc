# CETC mailing list - 2021

The mailing list for 2021 is complete.  It is located at [https://microeconomics.ca/mailman/listinfo/cetc](https://microeconomics.ca/mailman/listinfo/cetc) which is where anyone can join the subscription list or remove their name from the mailing list.

All the main organizers from toronto and ubc are list admins for the cetc list.  You can view the subscribers list for example.  The list at the start of this year will also be stored in a separate github repo (details soon).

To get more detailed information about the list, send an email message to [cetc@microeconomics.ca](cetc@microeconomics.ca) which the subject line `help` - really, thats it.  If your message is sent with your official university address it will tell you how to set your password so you can have admin access to the list.  

If you are using gmail or something as your usual address, it will let you join the list, then the admin settings can be adjusted.

There is a separate mailing list used for sending regular notices of cetc organized seminars at  [https://microeconomics.ca/mailman/listinfo/cetc](https://microeconomics.ca/mailman/listinfo/cetc)
