# CETC 2021

Given the current conditions, the new edition of the CETC (for 2021) is to take place in a format different than the usual. To encourage interaction, and to maintain a sense of community among Canadian and International theorists, papers will be presented (in an weekly online seminar format) in the upcoming term (January-April). Each presentation will run 60 minutes followed by 30 minutes of discussion and informal interaction in a chat room after the talk. (Seminars will be live streamed on [https://www.twitch.tv/cetc_seminars](https://www.twitch.tv/cetc_seminars). All presenters will be invited as panelists for all the talks. Viewers on twitch.tv will be welcomed post seminar to interact with presenters and panelists in our chat room which will be on a [discord](https://discord.com) server.
    
Submission deadline and selection process:
Submission is by email at cetc.conference@gmail.com. Submission deadline is January 15th but early submissions may be considered for early slots before the submission deadline. We will notify each presenter at least three weeks before the seminar is scheduled.
