# CETC 2021

Given the current conditions, the new edition of the CETC (for 2021) is to take place in a format different than the usual. To encourage interaction, and to maintain a sense of community among Canadian and International theorists, papers will be presented in a weekly online seminar format on each Thursday in the upcoming term (January-April). Each presentation will run 60 minutes followed by 30 minutes of discussion and informal interaction in a chat room after the talk. (Seminars will be live streamed on [https://www.twitch.tv/cetc_seminars](https://www.twitch.tv/cetc_seminars). All presenters will be invited as panelists for all the talks. Viewers on twitch.tv will be welcomed post seminar to interact with presenters and panelists in our chat room, which take place on a [discord](https://discord.com) server.)
    
Submission deadline and selection process:
Please contact the organizers, Anne-Katrin Roesler, Shunya Noda, and Gabor Virag (and others) at cetc.conference@gmail.com with your submission or if you have any questions. Submission deadline is January 15th but early submissions may be considered for early slots. We will notify each presenter at least three weeks before the seminar is scheduled.
