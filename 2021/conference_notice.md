# CETC 2021

Given the adverse conditions that continue to affect our profession, the new edition of the CETC (for 2021)  is to take place in a format different than the usual. To encourage interaction, and to maintain a sense of community among Canadian and International theorists, papers will be presented (in an weekly online seminar format) in the upcoming term (January-April) on a weekly basis. Each presentation will run 60 minutes followed by 30 minutes of discussion and informal interaction in a chat room after the talk. (Seminars will be live streamed on twitch.tv.  All  presenters will be invited as panelists for all the talks. Viewers on twitch.tv will be welcomed post seminar to interact with presenters and panelists in our chat room which will be on a discord (https://discord.com)  server.
         Submission deadline and selection process:
    Submission is at the following link at the CETC website (or you want to do email submission at cetc.conference@gmail.com?).  Submission opens up on November 20th, and submissions will be taken continuously until all slots are filled up but at least until February 1st. We plan to schedule the first few papers by mid December.
    When submitting please indicate the weeks (and times) you are available (the default is full availability from January to April). We will notify each presenter at least three weeks before the seminar is scheduled.
