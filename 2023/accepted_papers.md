A social choice function (SCF) is said to be Nash implementable if there exists a mechanism in which every Nash equilibrium outcome coincides with that specified by the SCF. The main objective of this paper is to assess the impact of considering mixed strategy equilibria in Nash implementation. To do this, we focus on environments with two agents and restrict attention to finite mechanisms. We call a mixed strategy equilibrium compelling if its outcome Pareto dominates any pure strategy equilibrium outcome. We show that if the finite environment and the SCF to be implemented jointly satisfy what we call Condition P+M, we construct a finite mechanism which Nash implements the SCF in pure strategies and possesses no compelling mixed strategy equilibria. This means that the mechanism might possess mixed strategy equilibria which are not compelling. Our mechanism has several desirable features: transfers can be completely dispensable; only finite mechanisms are considered; integer games are not invoked; and agents' attitudes toward risk do not matter. These features make our result quite distinct from many other prior attempts to handle mixed strategy equilibria in the theory of implementation. We also illustrate the difficulty of extending our result to the case of more than two agents.

## The Economics of Career Concerns in Teamwork

[Huseyin Yildirim](https://works.bepress.com/huseyin_yildirim/) Duke University

This paper examines career incentives in teamwork by allowing complementarity between e¤ort and talent à la Dewatripont, Jewitt, and Tirole (1999, REStud): talent means little without hard work and vice versa. The first result identifies an incentive reversal: with e¤ort-talent complementarity, less well-known (higher prior-variance) team members work harder [resp. less hard] if the marginal cost of e¤ort is convex [resp. concave]. Next, itis shown that organizations can create high-performance teams by increasing transparency among peers or emphasizing their collective reputation. Peer transparency facilitates e¤ort coordination and leads the "market" to expect more from the team, whereas the emphasis on the collective reputation often motivates the less career-concerned members. It is further shown that team members with similar or correlated talents work harder, suggesting positive sorting of talent into different tasks. Last, the paper explores optimal disclosure (rating) of individual performance and determines when to provide team vs. competitive incentives to maximize effort.

## Blackwell Correlated Equilibrium

We develop a method for making robust predictions in games with flexible information acquisition---i.e. rational inattention (Sims, 2003). In games with exogenous information, one can describe the set of attainable outcomes using Bergemann and Morris's (2016) Bayes correlated equilibrium (BCE). We introduce a refinement of BCE, Blackwell correlated equilibrium (BKE), and prove that it spans all outcomes attainable under some flexible learning technology whose costs increase in Blackwell's (1951, 1953) information order. We show the BKE set is either dense or nowhere dense in the BCE set, with the former being true for generic games. We conclude by exploring the implications of BKE on a Bertrand competition game, where we show the best BCE for consumers may not be approximable by BKEs.

We study the classic principal-agent model when the signal observed by the principal is chosen by the agent. We fully characterize the optimal information structure from an agent’s perspective in a general moral hazard setting. Unlike standard information design, only the support of the distribution of beliefs is relevant to the agent. We show that the problem can be mapped into a geometrical game between the principal and the agent in the space of likelihood ratios. We use this representation result to show that coarse contracts are sufficient: The agent can achieve her best with binary signals. Additionally, we characterize conditions under which the agent is able to extract all the surplus and implement the efficient allocation under full information. Finally, we show that when effort and performance are one-dimensional, under a general class of models, threshold signals are optimal.

We study a generalization of the classical monopoly insurance problem under adverse selection (see Stiglitz [1977]) where we allow for a random distribution of losses, possibly correlated with the agent’s risk parameter that is private information. Our model explains patterns of observed customer behavior and predicts insurance contracts most often observed in practice: these consist of menus of several deductible-premium pairs, or menus of insurance with coverage limits-premium pairs. The main departure from the classical insurance literature is obtained here by endowing the agents with risk-averse preferences that can be represented by a dual utility functional (Yaari [1987]).

## Reputation Effects under Short Memories

[Harry PEI](https://sites.northwestern.edu/harrypei/research/) Northwestern University

I study a novel reputation model in which a patient player interacts with a sequence of short-run players. Each short-run player can only observe the number of times that the patient player took each of his actions in the last K periods but not the exact sequence of these actions. When players' payoffs are monotone-supermodular, I show that the patient player can approximately secure his commitment payoff in all equilibria as long as K is at least one. I also show that the short-run players can approximately attain their highest feasible payoff in all equilibria if and only if K is lower than some cutoff. My proof uses a no-back-loop property, that it is never optimal for the patient player to first milk his reputation and later restore his reputation. I also introduce new techniques that can characterize the common properties of the patient player's behavior in all equilibria.

## A comprehensive revealed preference approach to approximate utility maximisation

[Pawel Karol Dziewulski](http://pawel-dziewulski.com)n Department of Economic, University of Sussex

We develop a comprehensive revealed preference method for studying preferences of individuals whose choices are inconsistent with utility maximisation. We assume that only the directly revealed strict preference relation reflects true preferences of the agent, while the weak one may be subject to imprecision, vagueness of judgement, or incommensurability. As a result, a natural consistency condition, acyclicity, is imposed on the former alone. We show that this restriction is necessary and sufficient for the data to be rationalisable with approximate utility maximisation, where an alternative is selected from a menu only if its utility is not significantly lower than that of any other available option. More importantly, although the individual may fail to maximise their utility exactly, it is possible to recover their true preferences from observations, make out-of-sample predictions and welfare comparisons. Our results require minimal assumptions on the empirical framework and are applicable, amongst others, to the study of choices over consumption bundles, state-contingent consumption, and lotteries.

## Non-Fundamental Volatility in Financial Markets

[Keisuke Teeple](http://keisuketeeple.wordpress.com) University of Waterloo

I use coarse Bayesian updating to explain three stylized facts: trading anomalies around major stock market milestones, excess price volatility and trade volume, and heavy-tailed prices. When expectations are coarse and traders are heterogeneous, traders make heterogeneous mistakes. This disagreement generates substantial trade volume and I show that the ensuing price discovery process converges in distribution to an empirically relevant class of Levy processes. Notably, I obtain this result without any exogenous shocks or processes; the only exogenous random variable is a heterogeneity parameter drawn at time zero. I then establish a perfectly non-revealing equilibrium: because traders are different, their aggregated trades generate volatile prices, yet this volatility impedes traders from learning their differences.

## Strategic Evidence Disclosure in Networks and Equilibrium Discrimination

[Rohan Dutta](https://sites.google.com/site/rohandutta/) Department of Economics, McGill University</

A group of agents with ex-ante independent and identically uncertain quality compete for a prize, awarded by a principal. Agents may possess evidence about the quality of those they share a social connection with (neighbours), and themselves. In one equilibrium, adversarial disclosure of evidence leads the principal to statistically discriminate between agents based on their number of neighbours (degree). We identify parameter values for which an agent’s ex-ante winning probability is monotone in degree. All equilibria that satisfy some robustness criteria lie between this adversarial disclosure equilibrium and a less informative one that features no snitching and no discrimination.

## Everybody’s Talkin’ at Me: Levels of Majority Language Acquisition by Minority Language Speakers

Immigrants in economies with a dominant native language exhibit substantial heterogeneities in language acquisition of the majority language. We model partial equilibrium language acquisition as an equilibrium phenomenon. We consider an environment where heterogeneous agents from various minority groups choose whether to acquire a majority language fully, partially, or not at all. Different acquisition decisions confer different communicative benefits and incur different costs. We offer an equilibrium characterization of language acquisition strategies and find that partial acquisition can arise as an equilibrium behavior. We also show that a language equilibrium may exhibit insufficient learning relative to the social optimum. In addition, we provide a local stability analysis of steady state language equilibria. Finally, we discuss econometric implementation of the language acquisition model and establish identification conditions.

## Rational Inattention and Endogenous Volatility in Games: A Large Deviation Approach

Consider a game where rationally inattentive agents acquire costly information about exogenous fundamentals and endogenous aggregate actions.  In a finite-agent game, endogenous volatility arises because individual and aggregate actions are conditionally correlated given the fundamentals. We define a large-game equilibrium as the limit of equilibria of finite-agent games with information acquisition as the number of agents approaches infinity. Our main results are: (i) Every large-game equilibrium exhibits no endogenous volatility, meaning that agents eventually learn only about the fundamentals and not about aggregate actions; (ii) The rate of convergence is such that the probability of aggregate actions deviating from the equilibrium aggregate actions decays exponentially in the number of agents. These results allow us to evaluate how accurately we can approximate games where agents can learn about both fundamentals and aggregate behavior by more tractable ones where agents learn only about fundamentals. Our proof uses large deviation theory because the law of large numbers is inapplicable when actions are correlated.

We develop a theory of monotone comparative statics for models with adjustment costs. We show that comparative statics conclusions may be drawn under the usual ordinal complementarity assumptions on the objective function, assuming very little about costs: only a mild monotonicity condition is required. We use this insight to provide a general treatment of the le Chatelier principle based on adjustment costs. We extend these results to<br />a fully dynamic model of adjustment over time: given only minimal<br />structure on costs, optimal adjustment follows a monotone path.  We apply our results to models of capital investment and of sticky prices.

## Strategy-proof Multi-Issue Mediation: An Application to Online Dispute Resolution

Mediation (assisted negotiation) is the preferred alternative dispute resolution approach that has given rise to a multi-billion-dollar industry worldwide. Online dispute resolution providers rely heavily on mechanized e-Negotiation systems.  We develop a novel framework where two negotiators with diametrically opposed preferences seek resolution over a main issue and a supplementary issue. Negotiators are either rational, in the sense that all alternatives in the main issue are negotiable and all outcomes are acceptable, or have reference-dependent preferences, in the sense that some alternatives in the main issue are non-negotiable and some outcomes are deal-breakers (i.e., when compared to the outside option or the status quo). Types are private information and negotiators report their bargaining ranges (set of negotiable alternatives) over the main issue. The mediation process is represented by a mechanism with voluntary participation. We characterize the full class of strategy-proof, efficient, and individually rational mediation mechanisms. A necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of such protocols is the so-called quid pro quo property; a weak condition that formulates preferences for compromise solutions.

## Competing to Commit: Markets with Rational Inattention

Two homogeneous-good firms compete for a consumer’s unitary demand. The consumer is rationally inattentive and pays entropy costs to process information about firms’ offers. Compared to a collusion benchmark, competition produces two effects. As in standard models, competition puts downward pressure on prices. But, additionally, an attention effect arises: Competition acts as a commitment device to keep market offers in check, allowing the consumer to engage in trade more often. For high enough attention costs, this attention effect dominates: Firms’ profits are higher under competition than under collusion. Our model can explain why markets with common ownership may remain competitive.

This paper presents arguments based on weak dominance and learning for se- lecting informative equilibria in a model of cheap-talk communication where play- ers must use monotonic strategies. Under a standard regularity condition, only one equilibrium survives iterated deletion of interim dominated strategies. Under the same condition, we establish that best-response dynamics converges to this outcome.
