# Canadian Economic Theory Conference
The conference in 2021 will consist of a series of weekly seminars organized by the University of Toronto.  These will run from mid-January through at least the end of April 2021.  Presentations will be live streamed at [https://twitch.tv/cetc_seminars](https://twitch.tv/cetc_seminars).  Each talk will last for an hour.  This will be followed by an informal meet and greet on a [discord](https://discord.com) server where you can chat individually with the presenter, any panelist or any twitch participant who you know.

To submit a paper to this seminar series, see the conference announcement on the main page [https://microeconomics.c](https://microeconomics.ca) for instructions.
