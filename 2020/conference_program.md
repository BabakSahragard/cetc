- Abstract
We study implementation under a weak informational assumption on agents' beliefs which maintains informational symmetry about other participants' types, without assuming the knowledge of distributions. Under this assumption, we characterize partial and full implementation. We find that partial implementation is possible in the same environments in which ex post implementation attains -- even though the set of implementing mechanisms is larger. For full implementation, common knowledge of identicality makes a difference; using this information about beliefs can ensure full implementation in many environments in which ex post implementation is not possible. To show these, we characterize the incentive compatible transfers under identical but unknown distributions. For full implementation, we construct the implementing transfers which load the canonical externalities to the agents who, in the baseline canonical mechanism, are least influenced by other agents' strategies. These loading transfers characterize full implementability. Moreover, these transfers minimize sensitivity, within the set of interim incentive compatible transfers, to limited levels of knowledge of rationality. Under symmetric aggregators in valuations, the equal-externality transfers, which evenly redistribute the canonical externalities across opponents, are the transfers which are more robust to mistakes in play.

These results extend to identical and independent but unknown distributions. Our results rely (1) on a novel characterization of incentive compatible transfers which highlights the role of additive application of belief-based terms in economic design and (2) on a novel eigen-value lemma which guarantees implementation in unique B-rationalizability.
