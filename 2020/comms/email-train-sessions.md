Dear Speaker,

We look forward to your presentation at the 2020 Canadian Economic Theory Conference.

To insure a smooth experience during the conference, we are setting up two small practice sessions to test everyone’s setup and familiarize you with the platform to be used. **We highly recommend that you participate in the training session** if possible. We will use the “webinar” option in the Zoom platform, which is somewhat different from standard meetings.

The session schedule is the following:
* Wednesday April 29th 9am-10am (PST). This one is for speakers presenting on the first day (May 8th)
* Thursday April 30th 9am-10am (PST). This one is for speakers presenting on the second day (May 9th)

Details for the training sessions:
* Access: use the link contained in the Zoom email inviting you to be a panelist. **Each presenter has a unique link. Make sure to save it.** 
  * Access for non-presenters is different, they should use [this registration link](https://zoom.us/webinar/register/7815870672342/WN_ZtYIUomiRPigDbo28x1sdg).
* Have the exact setup up to be used at the conference (computer, webcam, mic and room).
* Have some presentation slides open in your computer. No need to use the slides for your actual talk.
* We will go over all speakers within a day in the same order of the program.
* We will test: webcam, screen sharing and microphone.
* Plese read the instructions found [here](https://michaelpetersubc.github.io/cetc/2020/CETC-instructions) prior to the training session.

The conference program can be found [here](https://michaelpetersubc.github.io/cetc/2020/conference_program).

We also launched a Slack workspace for the conference. [This](https://join.slack.com/t/cetctalk/shared_invite/zt-dtk2f4lg-0mLgqf_L21T5KHRu4NjKyg) is the invitation link for the CETC workspace (the invitation link will expire in 30 days). Since we cannot have "offline" conversations in a online conference, we attempt to substitute it with Slack.

For those who are not familiar with Slack: Slack is a collaboration hub that can replace e-mail. Compared with e-mail or other social networking services (like Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn), Slack is designed for professional communications. For example, it is easier to make a "channel" (a chat group for talking about a specific issue). [Here](https://slack.com/intl/en-ca/help/articles/115004071768-What-is-Slack-) is the official guidance for Slack. Although you can access this workspace via your web browser, we recommend using Slack with the desktop app.

We are looking forward to the conference.
