Dear Speaker,

We look forward to your presentation at the 2020 Canadian Economic Theory Conference.

To insure a smooth experience during the conference, we are setting up two small practice sessions to test everyone’s setup and familiarize you with the platform to be used. We highly recommend that you participate in the training session if possible. We will use the “webinar” option in the Zoom platform, which is somewhat different from standard meetings.

The session schedule is the following:
* Wednesday April 29th 9am-10am (PST). This one is for speakers presenting on the first day (May 8th)
* Thursday April 30th 9am-10am (PST). This one is for speakers presenting on the second day (May 9th)

Details for the training sessions:
* Access: use the link contained in the Zoom email inviting you to be a panelist. Each presenter has a unique link. Make sure to save it. 
* Have the exact setup up to be used at the conference (computer, webcam, mic and room).
* Have some presentation slides open in your computer. No need to use the slides for your actual talk.
* We will go over all speakers within a day in the same order of the program.
* We will test: webcam, screen sharing and microphone.

The conference program can be found [here](https://michaelpetersubc.github.io/cetc/2020/conference_program). More detailed instructions can be found [here](https://michaelpetersubc.github.io/cetc/2020/CETC-instructions).

We are looking forward to the conference.
