Dear Presenters of CETC 2020,

A couple announcements:

1. A reminder to be online **20 minutes before the start of your session**. This will allow enough time for everyone to be properly setup.

2. **Presentation slides**: having access to your slides can be very helpful for the audience. If you are able and willing to share your slides, please **email them to [snoda@mail.ubc.ca](mailto:snoda@mail.ubc.ca) or send us a URL** through which your slides can be accessed (such as your website or dropbox). We will then add a link to your slides to the official program (Thanks to Nima for the recommendation).


We are looking forward to the presentations!

Shunya, Vitor, Mike, Sergei, Li Hao, Li Wei, Clemens
