Dear Presenters of CETC 2020,

A couple announcements:

1. A reminder to be online **20 minutes before the start of your session**. This will allow enough time for everyone to be properly setup.
2. **Presentation slides**: having access to your slides can be very helpful for the audience. If you are able and willing to share your slides, **please send a URL to Shunya Noda (shunya.noda@ubc.ca)** through which your slides can be accessed (such as your website or dropbox). We can add this link to the official program (Thanks to Nima for the recommendation).

We are looking forward to the presentations.

Shunya, Vitor, Mike, Sergei, Li Hao, Li Wei, Clemens
