Dear Participants of CETC 2020,

We look forward to your participation at the 2020 Canadian Economic Theory Conference.

Thank you very much for registrating the 2020 Canadian Economic Theory Conference. The conference will be held this weekend, on Friday May 8th and Saturday 9th. We are looking forward to (virtually) seeing you soon.

The conference program can be found [here](https://michaelpetersubc.github.io/cetc/2020/conference_program).
* The conference will be held as a Zoom webinar.
* When you registered for the conference, you should have received an e-mail titled "Canadian Economic Theory Conference Confirmation". Your personalized link for joining the conference is in that e-mail (find the "Click Here to Join" link).
* Day 1 starts at 6:50am on May 8th in PDT, and Day 2 starts at 7:00am on May 9th in PDT. You can drop in and out any time you'd like.
* For each speaker, we spend 30 minutes on a presentation and 10 minutes on Q&A.
* During the session, only moderators and conference presenters can speak. General participants can ask questions via the Zoom Q&A function, the Zoom chat, and the CETC Slack (see below). See **[the instruction](https://michaelpetersubc.github.io/cetc/2020/CETC-instructions)** for a full description.

**We launched a Slack workspace for CETC2020!** The idea is to use Slack as an imperfect substitute to regular "offline" conversations in a conference. You can request an invitation e-mail from **[this Google form.](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScgZQ4cSAIUgLg7OM-sC0BPf-Xj9tKLwHdodSb20HpOGUao2Q/viewform)**

For those not familiar with Slack: it is a collaboration hub that can replace e-mail. Compared with e-mail or social networking platforms (e.g. Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn), Slack is designed for professional communications. For example, it is easier to make a "channel" (a chat group for talking about a specific issue). [Here](https://slack.com/intl/en-ca/help/articles/115004071768-What-is-Slack-) is Slack's official guide. Once you join the CETC slack, you can access through your browser and, preferrably, the Slack application.

We would also appreciate any suggestions for improving the conference, especially how to promote informal discussions. You can post your suggestions on the CETC Slack workspace.

We are looking forward to the conference!
