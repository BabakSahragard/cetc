Dear Presenters of CETC 2020,

Thank you very much for presenting in the 2020 Canadian Economic Theory Conference. The conference will be held this weekend, on Friday May 8th and Saturday 9th. We are looking forward to (virtually) seeing you soon.

We have two important announcements:

**1. Your co-authors can become panelists.**

During the session, you can ask the moderator of your session to promote your co-author to a panelist. Then, the panelist can answer questions posted in the Q&A field, without stopping the main stream of the webinar. The promoted co-authors can also speak, so they can also answer the questions by Voice in the Q&A time.

We are grateful to Romans Pancs for this great suggestion.


**2. On Day 1 (Friday May 8th), we open a parallel coffee session.**

The idea is to encourage disucssion about the papers among presenters further. You can also talk in the webinar room, but because the webinar room is visible from all the participants, we thought that it might be better to launch a room that is not visible from the general audience.

The link for the coffee session is as follows. This link is shared exclusively with the presenters.

As we are not perfectly sure whether a parallel coffee session is useful, we only open it on Day 1 (Friday, May 8th). After the conference is over, we will ask you to make some feedback, and try to incorporate your opinion into the organization of future conferences.


Again, **we launched a Slack workspace for CETC2020!** The idea is to use Slack as an imperfect substitute to regular "offline" conversations in a conference. You can join the CETC2020 Slack workspace from **[this link](https://join.slack.com/t/cetctalk/shared_invite/zt-dtk2f4lg-0mLgqf_L21T5KHRu4NjKyg)**.

We would also appreciate any suggestions for improving the conference, especially how to promote informal discussions. You can post your suggestions on the CETC Slack workspace.

We are looking forward to the conference!
