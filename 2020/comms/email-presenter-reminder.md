Dear Presenters of CETC 2020,

Thank you very much for presenting in the 2020 Canadian Economic Theory Conference. The conference will be held this weekend, on Friday May 8th and Saturday 9th. We are looking forward to (virtually) seeing you soon.

We have three important announcements:

**1. Use your unique link to join the webinar!**

As we explained in the training session, **use the link contained in the Zoom email inviting you to be a panelist**. Each presenter has a unique link. Make sure to save it. Access for non-presenters is **different**, they should use [this registration link](https://zoom.us/webinar/register/9515870863740/WN_ZtYIUomiRPigDbo28x1sdg).

**2. Your co-authors can become panelists.**

If you'd like a co-author to be promoted to a panelist, please ask the assigned moderator before the start of the session. They will be able to answer questions posted in the Q&A field during the presentation and also speak at any moment. (Thanks to Romans Pancs for the suggestion.)

**3. On Day 1 (Friday May 8th), we open a parallel coffee session.**

The idea is to encourage disucssion about the papers among presenters further. You can also talk in the webinar room, but because the webinar room is visible from all the participants, we thought that it might be better to launch a room that is not visible from the general audience.

This coffee session is exclusive to presenters. Please do not share the acess information.
Coffee meeting information:
* Access through [this link](https://us02web.zoom.us/j/86466184298?pwd=NWdOQWZQQ1g1MGZ5cmRRZkFrQURjZz09). 
* Meeting ID: 864 6618 4298
* Password: 184153

How to use the parallel coffee meeting is up to you. For example, you can quit the webinar and enjoy chatting during the break time. You can also join the webinar room and coffee room simultaneously, using two different devices (you can use Zoom via your tablet or smartphone as well). If you'd like to join both the main webinar and parallel coffee meeting simulataneously using the same computer and same Zoom account, you seem to need a **paid** Zoom account. For the prerequistes and operations, please read [the official guide of Zoom](https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/360001120743-Join-Multiple-Meetings-Simultaneously-on-Desktop).

This coffee session will only be available on day 1. The idea is for day 2 to be a "control group" so that we can learn about the best way to encourage interactions. After the conference is over, we will ask you to make some feedback, and try to incorporate your opinion into the organization of future conferences.

Here is one more reminder. Again, **we launched a Slack workspace for CETC2020!** The idea is to use Slack as an imperfect substitute to regular "offline" conversations in a conference. You can join the CETC2020 Slack workspace from **[this link](https://join.slack.com/t/cetctalk/shared_invite/zt-dtk2f4lg-0mLgqf_L21T5KHRu4NjKyg)**.

We would also appreciate any suggestions for improving the conference, especially how to promote informal discussions. You can post your suggestions on the CETC Slack workspace.
